# ProPixeliser

ProPixelizer is a Unity package to render 3D objects in a pixelated, 2D sprite art style.

Redistribution of ProPixelizer is prohibited. If you obtained a copy by other means, please respect the efforts I made to develop and maintain ProPixelizer by purchasing a copy from the asset store:
